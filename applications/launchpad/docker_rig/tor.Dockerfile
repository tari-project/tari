# Tell Docker to periodically run curl as a way of checking that Tor is runnning OK,
# and is able to build a circuit. Link goes to a Tor Project page, which checks that
# client is accessing it through Tor network and not directly. It gives false negatives
# sometimes, so we should allow several retries.
#
# --socks5-hostname parameter is very important - it tells curl to ask proxy (Tor) for DNS lookup,
#   instead of doing it on its own - the behavior that torrc file above explicitly prohibits,
#   because it opens a possibility for a traffic correlation attack.
#
# --location flag is added just in case Tor Project changes the location of the page and puts a redirect at
#   the previos location, so curl can follow that redirect.
#
# grep gets the output of curl and looks for first occurence of the string 'Congratulations',
# exits with 0 if found and 1 otherwise. Nothing is printed to stdout during this command.
