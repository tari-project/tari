# that are 'orphans', i.e. transactions with inputs that don't exist in the UTXO set. If you're not mining, and
# memory usage is a concern, this can safely be set to zero. Even so, orphan transactions do not appear that often
# (it's usually a short chain of spends that are broadcast in quick succession). The other potential source of orphan
# transactions are from DOS attacks and setting the `tx_ttl` parameter to a low value is an effective countermeasure
# in this case. Default: 250 transactions
# orphan_pool_storage_capacity = 250

# The maximum amount of time an orphan transaction will be permitted to stay in the mempool before being rejected.

# The ReorgPool consists of all transactions that have recently been added to blocks.
# When a potential blockchain reorganization occurs the transactions can be recovered from the ReorgPool and can be
# added back into the UnconfirmedPool. Transactions in the ReOrg pool have a limited Time-to-live and will be removed
# from the pool when the Time-to-live thresholds is reached. Also, when the capacity of the pool has been reached, the

# This parameter only affects mining nodes. You can ignore it if you are only running a base node. Even so, changing

# memory usage is a concern, this can safely be set to zero. Even so, orphan transactions do not appear that often
# (it's usually a short chain of spends that are broadcast in quick succession). The other potential source of orphan

# The ReorgPool consists of all transactions that have recently been added to blocks.

# from the pool when the Time-to-live thresholds is reached. Also, when the capacity of the pool has been reached, the
