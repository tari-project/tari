# Standalone miner for the Tari network

The Tari Miner application should be running connected to the Tari Base Node and the Tari Console Wallet,
allowing it insert the coinbase transactions created by the Tari Console Wallet and to to mine blocks matching the
required network difficulty. This also serves as a reference implementation for custom miners that which can be derived
from it.

### Installation

Please refer to the relevant section in the main
[README installation section](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/blob/development/README.md#install-and-run).

### Configuration

When running with local versions of the Tari Base Node and the Tari Console Wallet, no additional configuration other
than what is described in the main
[README configuration section](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/blob/development/README.md#tari-sha3-mining)
is required. The Tari Miner can also be located on a remote workstation.

Configuration options for the Tari Miner are as follows:

- `base_node_grpc_address` - this is IPv4/IPv6 address including port number, by which the Tari Base Node can be found;
- `wallet_grpc_address` - this is IPv4/IPv6 address including port number, by which the Tari Console Wallet can be
  found;
- `num_mining_threads` - the number of mining threads, which defaults to the number of CPU cores;
- `mine_on_tip_only` - mining will only start when the Tari Base Node reports it is in the bootstrapped state;
- `validate_tip_timeout_sec` - the interval at which the current block height will be checked to determine if mining
  must be restarted, whereby the tip might have advanced passed the block height that is in use in the current template.

### Caveats

Currently, the Tari Miner only supports SHA3 mining; this is adequate for the current Tari protocol.
