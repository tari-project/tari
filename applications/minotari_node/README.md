# Minotari base node

# OSX
## Installation from binaries

If you've downloaded binaries from [the Tari homepage](https://tari.com/downloads), then installing the base node is
relatively simple.

1. Extract the contents of the zip archive to a convenient location (e.g. `/Users/your_name/tari_node`). Since you're
   reading this file, you've probably done this already.
2. Give the `minotari_node` executable permission to run on your machine. Right-click on the `minotari_node`
   executable in Finder, select `Open`, and then click `Open`. The node will exit with an error, but this is fine; all
   we wanted to do is tell your Mac that it's ok to run this program.
3. Run `install.sh` by double clicking on it, or entering `./install.sh` in a terminal.
4. When you see the node prompt, you're good to go!
