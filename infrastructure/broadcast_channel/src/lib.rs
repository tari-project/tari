//! # Lock-free Bounded Non-Blocking Pub-Sub Queue
//!
//! This is a publish subscribe pattern queue, where the publisher is never blocked by
//! slow subscribers. The side effect is that slow subscribers will miss messages. The intended
//! use-case are high throughput streams where receiving the latest message is prioritized over
//! receiving the entire stream. Market Data Feeds, Live Streams, etc....
//!
//! The underlying data-structure is a vector of Arc(s) eliminating the use of copies.
//!
//! ## Features
//! * Lock-Free Write/Read - Lock-Free for Publisher and Lock-Free for Subscribers.
//! * Bounded - Constant size of memory used, max is `sizeof(MsgObject)*(queue_size + sub_cnt + 1)`. This is an
//!   edge-case where each subscriber is holding a ref to an object while the publisher has published a full length of
//!   queue in the mean time.
//! * Non-Blocking - The queue never blocks the publisher, slow subscribers miss data proportinal to their speed.
//! * Pub-Sub - Every Subscriber that can keep up with the Publisher will recieve all the data the Publisher publishes.
//! * [`sync`]/[`async`] - both interfaces are provided, as well as a bare queue implementation without the thread
//!   synchronisation ,and futures logic.
//! * std::sync::mpsc like interface - The API is modeled after the standard library mpsc queue, channel function are
//!   used to create a tuple of (Publisher, Subscriber), while the Clone trait on Subscriber creates additional
//!   subscribers to the same Publisher.
//!
//! [`sync::Publisher`], [`async::Publisher`], and [`BarePublisher`] are used to broadcast data to
//! [`sync::Subscriber`], [`async::Subscriber`], and [`BareSubscriber`] pools. Subscribers are
//! clone-able such that many threads, or futures, can receive data simultaneously. The only
//! limitation is that Subscribers have to keep up with the frequency of the Publisher. If a
//! Subscriber is slow it will drop data.
//!
//! ## Disconnection
//!
//! The broadcast and receive operations on channels will all return a [`Result`]
//! indicating whether the operation succeeded or not. An unsuccessful operation
//! is normally indicative of the other half of a channel having "hung up" by
//! being dropped in its corresponding thread.
//!
//! Once half of a channel has been deallocated, most operations can no longer
//! continue to make progress, so [`Err`] will be returned. Many applications
//! will continue to [`unwrap`] the results returned from this module,
//! instigating a propagation of failure among threads if one unexpectedly dies.
//!
//!
//! # Examples
//! ## Simple raw usage
//! ```rust
//! use tari_broadcast_channel::raw_bounded;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let (tx, rx) = raw_bounded(10);
//!     (1..15).for_each(|x| tx.broadcast(x).unwrap());
//!
//!     let received: Vec<i32> = rx.map(|x| *x).collect();
//!     // Test that only the last 10 elements are in the received list.
//!     let expected: Vec<i32> = (5..15).collect();
//!
//!     assert_eq!(expected, received);
//! }
//! ```
//! ## Simple asynchronous usage
//! ```rust
//! # use tari_broadcast_channel::bounded;
//! # use futures::executor::block_on;
//! # use futures::StreamExt;
//! # use futures::stream;
//!
//! let (publisher, subscriber1) = bounded(10);
//! let subscriber2 = subscriber1.clone();
//!
//! block_on(async move {
//!     stream::iter(1..15).map(|i| Ok(i)).forward(publisher).await.unwrap();
//! });
//!
//! let received1: Vec<u32> = block_on(async { subscriber1.map(|x| *x).collect().await });
//! let received2: Vec<u32> = block_on(async { subscriber2.map(|x| *x).collect().await });
//! // Test that only the last 10 elements are in the received list.
//! let expected = (5..15).collect::<Vec<u32>>();
//! assert_eq!(received1, expected);
//! assert_eq!(received2, expected);
