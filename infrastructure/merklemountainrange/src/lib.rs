//! The Merkle mountain range was invented by Peter Todd more about them can be read at:
//! https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md

//!
//! A Merkle mountain range(MMR) is a binary tree where each parent is the concatenated hash of its two
//! children. The leaves at the bottom of the MMR is the hashes of the data. The MMR allows easy to add and proof
//! of existence inside of the tree. MMR always tries to have the largest possible single binary tree, so in effect
//! it is possible to have more than one binary tree. Every time you have to get the merkle root (the single merkle
//! proof of the whole MMR) you have the bag the peaks of the individual trees, or mountain peaks.
//!
//! Lets take an example of how to construct one. Say you have the following MMR already made:
//! '''
//!       /\
//!      /  \
//!     /\  /\   /\
//!    /\/\/\/\ /\/\ /\
//! '''
//! From this we can see we have 3 trees or mountains. We have constructed the largest possible tree's we can.
//! If we want to calculate the merkle route we will bag each of the mountains in the following way
//! '''
//!          /\
//!         /\ \
//!        /  \ \
//!       /\   \ \
//!      /  \   \ \
//!     /\  /\  /\ \
//!    /\/\/\/\/\/\/\
//! '''
//! Lets continue the example, by adding a single object. Our MMR now looks as follows
//! '''
//!       /\
//!      /  \
//!     /\  /\   /\
//!    /\/\/\/\ /\/\ /\ /
//! '''
//! We now have 4 mountains. Lets bag and calculate the merkle root again
//! '''
//!           /\
//!          /\ \
//!         /\ \ \
//!        /  \ \ \
//!       /\   \ \ \
//!      /  \   \ \ \
//!     /\  /\  /\ \ \
//!    /\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \
//! '''
//!  Lets continue thw example, by adding a single object. Our MMR now looks as follows
//! '''
//!           /\

//!    /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

//! Now we only have a single binary tree, we dont have to bag the mountains to calculate the merkle root. This
//! process continues as you add more objects to the MMR.

//! Due to the unique way the MMR is constructed we can easily represent the MMR as a list of the nodes, as when
//! adding nodes you only append. Lets take the following MMR and number the nodes in the order we create them.
//! '''
//!        7
//!       /  \
//!      /    \
//!     3      6
//!    / \    / \
//!   1   2  4   5
//! '''
//! Looking above at the example of when you create the nodes, you will see the nodes will have been created in the
//! order as they are named. This means we can easily represent them as a list:
//! Height:  0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2
//! Node:    1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
//!
//! Because of the list nature of the MMR we can easily navigate around the MMR using the following formulas:
//! Jump to sibling : 2^(H+1) -1
//! find peak : 2^(H+1) -2 where < total elements
//! left down : 2^H
//! right down: -1
//! Note that the formulas are for direct indexes in the array, meaning the nodes count from 0 and not 1 as in
//! the examples above. H - Height
//! I - Index
//!
//! Pruning the MMR means flagging a node as pruned and only removing it if its sibling has been removed.
//! We do this as we require the sibling to prove the hash of the node. Taking the above example, let's prune leaf 1.

//! Node 1 has now only been marked as pruned but we cannot remove it as of yet because we still require it to
