# RFC
RFC documents for the Tari protocol

We're working hard on a draft proposal that we hope you will love. Keep an eye on this space. In the meantime, you can 
join the conversation in one of our [conversation channels](#conversation-channels)

The [Glossary](Glossary.md) defines most of blockchain-specific the terms used throughout the Tari codebase and in
technical discussions.

# Layout

```text
|- DISCLAIMER.md. Legal stuff.
|- README.md. You're looking at it.
|- proposals/ Highly volatile discussion documents. Idea pitches and proposals. Expect debate, back-and-forth and 
|             robust argument. After some level of consensus has been reached, proposals can morph into and migrate 
|             to the RFC folder.
|- RFC/ Something approaching specification documents for Tari. Comments and improvements are still welcome at this 
        point, but things should start to congeal, if not solidify at this point.
