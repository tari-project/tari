# RFC-0220: Asset checkpoints

RFC placeholder.

This document will describe the mechanism for Asset Checkpoints. To make up for the fact that the DAN has no
proof-of-work and therefore has lower degrees of trustlessness and decentralisation; VN committees must provide
checkpoints on the base layer from time to time. These checkpoints are, amongst other things, immutable commitments to
the state of an asset at a point in time.
