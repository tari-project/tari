## Descriptions

### Syncing

When a new node comes online, loses connection or encounters a chain re-organisation that is longer than it can tolerate, it must enter syncing mode. This will allow it to recover its state to the newest up to date state. Syncing can be divided into 2 [SynchronisationStrategy]s, complete sync and sync. Complete sync will mean that the node communicates with an archive node to get the complete history of every single block from genesis block. Sync will involve the node getting every block from its [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon) to [current head](current head), as well as every block header from genesis block. 

#### Complete Sync

Complete sync is only available from archive nodes, as these will be the only nodes that will be able to supply the complete history required to sync every block with every transaction from genesis block up onto [current head](currenthead). 



#### Syncing process

The syncing process MUST be done in the following steps:

1. Set [SynchronisationState] to `Synchronising`.
2. Asks peers for their latest block, so it can get the total proof of work. 
3. Choose the longest chain based on total PoW done on that chain.
4. Selects a connected peer with the longest chain to sync from, this is based on the following criteria:
   1. Does the peer have a high enough [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon).
   2. Does the peer allow syncing.
   3. Does the peer have a low latency.
5. Download all headers from genesis block up onto [current head](currenthead), and validate the headers as you receive them.
6. Download [UTXO](utxo) set at [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon). 
7. Download all blocks from  [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon) up to [current head](currenthead), if the node is doing a complete sync, the [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon) will just be infinite, which means you will download all blocks ever created.
8. Validate blocks as if they where just mined and then received, in chronological order. 

After this process the node will be in sync and able to process blocks and transaction normally. 

#### Keeping in sync

The node SHOULD periodically test its peers with ping messages to ensure that they are alive. When a node sends a ping message, it MUST include the current total PoW, hash of the [current head](currenthead) and genesis block hash of its own current longest chain in the ping message. The receiving node MUST reply with a pong message also including the total PoW, [current head](currenthead) and genesis block hash of its longest chain. If the two chains don't match up, the node with the lowest PoW has the responsibility to ask the peer for syncing information and set [SynchronisationState] to `Synchronising`. 

If the genesis block hashes don't match, the node is removed from its peer list as this node is running a different blockchain. 

This will be handled by the node asking for each block header from the [current head](currenthead) going backward for older blocks until a known block is found. If a known block is found, and it has missing blocks it MUST set [SynchronisationState] to `Synchronising` while it is busy catching up those blocks.

If no block is found, the node will enter sync mode and resync. It cannot recover from its state as the fork is older than its [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon).

#### Chain forks

Chain forks can be a problem since in Mimblewimble not all nodes keep the complete transaction history, the design philosophy is more along the lines of only keeping the current [Blockchain state](blockchainstate). However, if such a node only maintains only the current [Blockchain state](blockchainstate) it is not possible for the node to "rewind" its state to handle forks in the chain history. In this case, a mode must re-sync its chain to recover the necessary transaction history up onto its [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon).

To counter this problem we use  [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon), this allows every [node](base node) to be a "light" [archival node](archivenode). This in effect means that the node will keep a full history for a short while. If the node encounters a fork it can easily rewind its state to apply the fork. If the fork is longer than the [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon), the node will enter a sync state where it will resync. 

### Pruning and cut-through

[Pruning and cut-through]: #Pruning-and-cut-through	"Remove already spent outputs from the [utxo]"

In Mimblewimble, the state can be completely verified using the current [UTXO](utxo) set (which contains the output commitments and range proofs), the set of excess signatures (contained in the transaction kernels) and the proof-of-work. The full block and transaction history is not required. This allows base layer nodes to remove old used inputs from the [blockchain] and or the [mempool]. [Cut-through](cut-through) happens in the [mempool] while pruning happens in the [blockchain] with already confirmed transactions. This will remove the spent inputs and outputs, but will retain the excesses of each [transaction]. 

Pruning is only for the benefit of the local base node as it reduces the local blockchain size. Pruning only happens after the block is older than the [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon) height. A Base node will either run in archive mode or prune mode, if the base node is running in archive mode it MUST NOT prune. 

When running in pruning mode, [base node]s have the following responsibilities:

1. MUST remove all spent outputs that is older than the [pruning horizon](pruninghorizon) in it's current stored [UTXO](utxo) when a new block is received from another [base node].
