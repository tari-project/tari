## Goals

The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to specify the binary serialization of:

1. a mined Tari block
1. a Tari block mining template

This is to facilitate interoperability of mining software and hardware.

## Specification

By reviewing the [block and mining template fields](#tari-block-and-mining-template-data-types) below, we have the following underlying data types for serialization:

1. `bool`
1. `u8`
1. `u16`
1. `u32`
1. `Vec<u8>`

For 1. to 4. and all numbers, [Base 128 Varint] encoding MUST be used.

From the Protocol Buffers documentation:

> Varints are a method of serializing integers using one or more bytes. Smaller numbers take a smaller number of bytes. Each byte in a varint, except the last byte, has the most significant bit (msb) set â€“ this indicates that there are further bytes to come. The lower 7 bits of each byte are used to store the two's complement representation of the number in groups of 7 bits, least significant group first.

For 5., the dynamically sized `Vec` array type, the encoded array MUST be preceded by a number indicating the length of the array. This length MUST also be encoded as a varint. By prepending the length of the array, the decoder knows how many elements to decode as part of the sequence.

[base 128 varint]: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints

## Block field ordering

Using this varint encoding, all fields of the complete block MUST be encoded in the following order:

1. Version
2. Height
3. Previous block hash
4. Timestamp
5. Output Merkle root
6. Witness Merkle root
7. Output Merkle mountain range size
8. Kernel Merkle root
9. Kernel Merkle mountain range size
10. Input Merkle root
11. Total kernel offset
12. Total script offset
13. Nonce
14. Proof of work algorithm
15. Proof of work supplemental data
16. Transaction inputs - for each input:
    - Flags
    - Maturity
    - Commitment
    - Script
    - Input data
    - Script signature
    - Sender Offset
17. Transaction outputs - for each output:
    - Flags
    - Maturity
    - Commitment
    - Range proof
    - Script
    - Sender Offset
    - Signature
18. Transaction kernels - for each kernel:
    - Features
    - Fee
    - Lock height
    - Excess
    - Excess signature public nonce
    - Excess signature

## Mining template field ordering

The [new block template](#mining-template-header) is provided to miners to complete. Its fields MUST also be encoded using varints, in the following order:

1. Version
2. Height
3. Previous block hash
4. Total kernel offset
5. Total script offset
6. Proof of work algorithm
7. Proof of work supplemental data
8. Target difficulty
9. Reward
10. Total fees
11. Transaction inputs - for each input:
    - Flags
    - Maturity
    - Commitment
    - Script
    - Input data
    - Script signature
    - Sender Offset
12. Transaction outputs - for each output:
    - Flags
    - Maturity
    - Commitment
    - Range proof
    - Script
    - Sender Offset
    - Signature
13. Transaction kernels - for each kernel:
    - Features
    - Fee
    - Lock height
    - Excess
    - Excess signature public nonce
    - Excess signature

## Tari Block and Mining Template - Data Types

A Tari block is comprised of the [block header] and [aggregate body].

Here we describe the respective Rust types of these fields in the [tari codebase], and their underlying data types:

| Proof of Work Data      | `Vec<u8>`        | `Vec<u8>` | Supplemental proof of work data. For Sha3 this would be empty, but for a Monero block we need the Monero header and RandomX seed hash. |
| Target Difficulty       | `Difficulty`     | `u64`     | The minimum difficulty required to satisfy the Proof of Work for the block                                                             |
| Reward                  | `MicroTari`      | `u64`     | The value of the emission for the coinbase output for the block                                                                        |
| Total Fees              | `MicroTari`      | `u64`     | The sum of all transaction fees in this block                                                                                          |
