# Description



## Background

### Alternative Approaches

In order to easily differentiate different [digital asset]s in the DAN, apart from some unique unpronounceable 
character string, a human readable identifier (domain name) is required. It is perceived that shorter names will have 
higher value due to branding and marketability, and the question is how this can be managed elegantly. It is also 
undesirable if for example the real Disney is forced to use the long versioned "*disney.com-goofy-is-my-asset-yes*" 
because some fake Disneys claimed "*goofy*" and "*disney.com-goofy*" and everything in between.

One method to curb name space squatting is to register names on the [base layer] layer with a domain name registration 
transaction. Let us call such a name a Registered Asset Issuer Name (RAIN). To make registering RAINs difficult enough 
to prevent spamming the network, a certain amount of [Tari coins] must be committed in a burn (permanently destroy) or 
a time locked pay to self type transaction. Lots of management overhead will be associated with such a scheme, even if 
domain-less assets are allowed. However, it would be impossible to stop someone 
from registering say a "*disney.com*" RAIN if they do not own the real "*disney.com*" Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

Another approach would be to make use of the public Domain Name System (DNS) and to link the FQDNs, that are already 
registered, to the [digital asset]s in the DAN, making use of [OpenAlias](https://openalias.org/) text (TXT) DNS 
records on a FQDN. Let us call this a Registered Asset Issuer Domain (RAID) TXT record. If we hash a public key and 
FQDN pair, it will provide us with a unique RAID_ID (RAID Identification). The RAID_ID will serve a similar purpose in 
the DAN as a Top Level Domain (TLD) in a DNS, as all digital assets belonging to a specific [asset issuer] could then 
be grouped under the FQDN by inference. To make this scheme more elaborate, but potentially unnecessary, all such 
RAID_IDs could be also be registered on the [base layer] layer, similar to the RAIN scheme.

If the standard Mimblewimble protocol is to be followed, a new output feature can be defined to cater for a RAID tuple 
`(RAID_ID, PubKey)` that is linked to a specific Unspent Transaction Output ([UTXO]). The `RAID_ID` could be based on 
a [Base58Check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) variant applied to `Hash256(PubKey || FQDN)`. If the 
amount of Tari coins associated with the RAID tuple transaction is burned, `(RAID_ID, PubKey)` will forever be present 
on the blockchain and can assist with blockchain bloat. On the other hand, if those [Tari coins] are spent back to its 
owner with a specific time lock, it will be possible to spend and prune that UTXO later on. While that UTXO remains 
unspent, the RAID tuple will be valid, but when all or part of it is spent, the RAID tuple will disappear from the 
blockchain. Such a UTXO will thus be "colored" while unspent as it will have different properties to a normal UTXO. It 
will also be possible to recreate the original RAID tuple by registering it using the original `Hash256(PubKey || FQDN)`.

Thinking about the makeup of the `RAID_ID` it is evident that it can easily be calculated on the fly using the public 
key and FQDN, both of which values will always be known. The biggest advantage having the RAID tuple on the [base 
layer] is that of embedded consensus, where it will be validated (as no duplicates can be allowed) and mined before it 
can be used. However, this comes at the cost of more complex code, a more elaborate asset registration process and 
higher asset registration fees.

### This RFC

This document explores the creation and use of RAID TXT records to link asset issuer specified domain names with 
digital assets on the [DAN], without RAID_IDs being registered on the [base layer].



## Requirements



### OpenAlias TXT DNS Records

An OpenAlias TXT DNS record [[1]] on a FQDN is a single string and starts with "*oa1:\<name\>*" field followed by a 
number of key-value pairs. Standard (optional) key-values are: "*recipient_address*"; "*recipient_name*"; 
"*tx_description*"; "*tx_amount*"; "*tx_payment_id*"; "*address_signature*" and "*checksum*". Additional key-values 
may also be defined. Only entities with write access to a specific DNS record will be able to create the required TXT 
DNS record entries.

TXT DNS records are limited to multiple strings of size 255, and as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) size is 512 bytes, a TXT DNS record that exceeds that limit is less optimal [[2], Sections 3.3 & 3.4].

**Req** - Integration with public DNS records MUST be used to ensure valid ownership of an FQDN that needs to be 
linked to a [digital asset] on the DAN. 

**Req** - The total size of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST not exceed 512 characters.

**Req** - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record implementation MUST make provision to interpret entries that are made up of more than one string as defined in [[2]].

**Req** - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST be constructed as follows:

| OpenAlias TXT DNS Record Field | OpenAlias TXT DNS Record Data                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| oa1:\<name\>                   | "oa1:tari_raid"                                              |
| fqdn                           | \<FQDN\>                                                     |
| pub_key                        | \<256 bit public key in hexadecimal format excluding the leading "0x" (64 characters)\> |
| raid_id                        | \<`RAID_ID` (*see [The RAID_ID](#the-raid_id)*) in hexadecimal format excluding the leading "0x" (44 characters)\> |
| pub_nonce                      | \<256 bit public nonce in hexadecimal format excluding the leading "0x" (64 characters)\> |
| signature                      | \<[Asset issuer]'s 256 bit Schnorr signature for the `RAID_ID` (*see [The RAID_ID](#the-raid_id)*), in hexadecimal format excluding the leading "0x" (64 characters)\> |
| description                    | \<Optional RAID description\>                                |
| checksum                       | \<CRC-32 checksum of the entire record up to but excluding the checksum key-value pair, in hexadecimal format excluding the leading "0x" (8 characters)\> |

**Req** - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST adhere to the formatting requirements as specified in [[1]].



### The RAID_ID

Because the `RAID_ID` does not exist as an entity on the base layer or in the [DAN], it cannot be owned or 
transferred, but only be verified as part of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record [[1]] verification. If an asset creator 
chooses not to link a `RAID_ID` and FQDN, a default network assigned `RAID_ID` will be used in the digital asset 
registration process.

**Req** - A default `RAID_ID` MUST be used where it will not be linked to a FQDN, for example it MAY be derived
from a default input string `"No FQDN"`.

**Req** - A FQDN linked (non-default) `RAID_ID` MUST be derived from the concatenation `PubKey || <FQDN>`.

**Req** - All concatenations of inputs for any hash algorithm MUST be done without adding any spaces.

**Req** - Deriving a `RAID_ID` follows the general process of creating a Bitcoin address [[3]] and MUST be calculated 
as follows:

- Inputs for all hashing algorithms used to calculate the `RAID_ID` MUST be lower case characters.
- The `Hash256` algorithm is not prescribed, but MUST be consistently used and MUST produce a 64 character (256 bit) 
  hexadecimal output.
- Stage 1 - MUST select the input string to use (either `"No FQDN"` or `PubKey || <FQDN>`).
  - Example: Mimblewimble public key `6be6f34b657b785e558e85cc3b8bdb5bcbe8c10e7e58524c8027da7727e189ef` and FQDN `disney.com`
     is used here, resulting in `6be6f34b657b785e558e85cc3b8bdb5bcbe8c10e7e58524c8027da7727e189efdisney.com`.
- Stage 2 - MUST perform `Hash256` hashing on the input from stage 1.
  - Example: `01df567efd2d3db687f78aeb2cdb3b045a651f241165165cd65824fe30c4eed8`
- Stage 3 - MUST perform `RIPEMD-160` hashing on the result of stage 2.
  - Example: `372180e923b2ba4bc84e1fae908bcbda387afe13`
- Stage 4 - MUST concatenate the `RAID_ID` identifier byte, `3c`, with the result of stage 3.
  - Example: `3c372180e923b2ba4bc84e1fae908bcbda387afe13`
- Stage 5 - MUST perform `Hash256` hashing on the extended result of stage 4.
  - Example: `c46df8650aab0e90622a13742b5f391a0598142ef96be47db9c59a0ddda8b82f`
- Stage 6 - MUST perform `Hash256` hashing on the result of stage 5.
  - Example: `7ccdbb1ad04cf63a6ae09432b1882aba4ffb820b1fa93f8765054da2bdcb1bf2`
- Stage 7 - MUST take the first 4 bytes of the result of stage 6; this is the address checksum.
  - Example: `7ccdbb1a`
- Stage 8 - MUST concatenate the extended result of stage 4 with the 4 checksum bytes from stage 7. This is the 
  25-byte binary address for the `RAID_ID`.
  - Example: `3c372180e923b2ba4bc84e1fae908bcbda387afe137ccdbb1a`
- Stage 9 - MUST convert the result of stage 8 from a byte string into a base58 string using `Base58Check` encoding. 
  This will result in a 34 character string starting with `R`.
  - Example: The resulting `RAID_ID` will be `REJhNwAdszLTteYuhY7KFTko4Q5CaVrvSu`.

**Req** - A valid `RAID_ID` signature MUST be a 256 bit Schnorr signature defined as `s = PvtNonce + e·PvtKey` with 
the challenge `e` being `e = Hash256(PubNonce || PubKey || RAID_ID)`.



### Sequence of Events

The sequence of events leading up to digital asset registration are perceived as follows:

1. The [asset issuer] will decide if the default `RAID_ID` or a `RAID_ID` that is linked to a FQDN must be used for 
   asset registration. 
   (_**Note:** A single linked (`RAID_ID`, FQDN) tuple may be associated with multiple digital assets from the same asset issuer._)

2. **Req** - If a default `RAID_ID` is required:

   1. The asset issuer MUST use the default `RAID_ID` (see [The RAID_ID](#the-raid_id)).
   2. The asset issuer MUST NOT sign the `RAID_ID`.

3. **Req** - If a linked (`RAID_ID`, FQDN) tuple is required:
   1. The asset issuer MUST create a `RAID_ID`.
   2. The asset issuer MUST sign the `RAID_ID` as specified (see [The RAID_ID](#the-raid_id)).
   3. The asset issuer MUST create a valid TXT DNS record (see [OpenAlias TXT DNS Records](#openalias-txt-dns-records)).

4. **Req** - [Validator Node]s (VN) MUST only allow a valid `RAID_ID` to be used in the digital asset registration 
   process.

5. **Req** - VNs MUST verify the OpenAlias TXT DNS record if a linked (`RAID_ID`, FQDN) tuple is used:
   1. Verify that all fields have been completed as per the specification (see [OpenAlias TXT DNS Records](#openalias-txt-dns-records)).
   2. Verify that the `RAID_ID` can be calculated from information provided in the TXT DNS record.
   3. Verify that the asset issuer's `RAID_ID` signature is valid.
   4. Verify that the FQDN corresponds to the public DNS record it is in.
   5. Verify the checksum.



### Confidentiality and Security

To prevent client lookups from leaking, OpenAlias recommends making use of [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), 
resolution via DNSCrypt-compatible resolvers that support Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and without 
DNS requests being logged.

**Req** - [Token Wallet]s (TW) and VNs SHOULD implement the following confidentiality and security measures when 
dealing with OpenAlias TXT DNS records:

- All queries SHOULD make use of the DNSCrypt protocol.
- Resolution SHOULD be forced via DNSCrypt-compatible resolvers that
  - support DNSSEC;
  - do not log DNS requests.
- The DNSSEC trust chain validity:
  - SHOULD be verified;
  - SHOULD be reported back to the [asset issuer].
