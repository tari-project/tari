## Goals

This document will propose the functionality and techniques required by the [Base Layer] Tari [wallet] module. The module
exposes the core wallet functionality that user-facing wallet applications may be built on.

## Related RFCs

This RFC is derived from a proposal first made in [this issue](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues/17).

## Description

### Key responsibilities

The wallet software is responsible for constructing and negotiating [transaction]s for transferring and receiving [Tari coin]s on the Base Layer. It should also provide functionality to generate, store and recover a master seed key and derived cryptographic key pairs that can be used for Base Layer addresses and signing of transactions.

### Details of functionality

A detailed description of the required functionality of the Tari software wallet is provided in three parts:
* Basic transaction functionality,
* Key management features and
* the different wallet recovery methods.

#### Basic transaction functionality

- It MUST be able to send and receive Tari coins using [Mimblewimble] transactions.
- It SHOULD be able to establish a connection between different user wallets to negotiate:
  - the construction of a transaction and
  - the signing of multi signature transactions.
- The Tari software wallet SHOULD be implemented as a library or API so that GUI or CLI applications can be developed on top of it.
- It MUST be able to establish a connection to a [Base Node] to submit transactions and monitor the Tari [blockchain].
- It SHOULD maintain an internal ledger to keep track of the Tari coin balance of the wallet.
- It MAY offer transaction fee estimation taking into account:
  - transaction byte size,
  - network congestion and
  - the desired transaction priority.
- It SHOULD be able to monitor and return the states (Spent, Unspent or Unconfirmed) of previously submitted transactions by querying information from the connected base node.
- The Wallet SHOULD present the total Spent, Unspent or Unconfirmed transactions in summarised form. 
- The wallet software SHOULD be able to update its software to patch potential security vulnerabilities. Automatic updating SHOULD be selected by default, but users can decide to opt out.
- Wallet features requiring querying a base node for information, SHOULD have caching capabilities to reduce bandwidth consumption.

#### Key management features

- It MUST be able to generate a master seed key for the wallet by using one of:
  - input from a user (for example, when restoring a wallet, or in testing),
  - a user defined set of mnemonic word sequences using known word lists,
  - a cryptographically secure random number generator.
- It SHOULD be able to generate derived transactional cryptographic key pairs from the master seed key using deterministic key pair generation.
- It SHOULD store the wallet state using a password or passphrase encrypted persistent key-value database.
- It SHOULD provide the ability to backup the wallet state to a single encrypted file to simplify wallet recovery and reconstruction at a later stage.
- It MAY provide the ability to export the master seed key or wallet state as a printable paper wallet using coded markers.

#### Different methods for recovering the wallet state of the Tari software wallet:
- It MUST be able to reconstruction the wallet state from a manually entered master seed key. 
- It MUST have a mechanism to systematically search through the Tari blockchain and mempool for unspent and unconfirmed transactions using the keys derived from the master key.
- The master seed key SHOULD be derivable from a specific set of mnemonic word sequences using known word lists.
- It MAY enable the reconstruction of the master seed key by scanning a coded marker of a paper wallet.
