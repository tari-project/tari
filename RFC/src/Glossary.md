# Tari Network Terminology

Below are a list of terms and their definitions that are used throughout the Tari code and documentation. Let's use this
glossary to disambiguate ideas, and work towards a
[ubiquitous language](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2016/10/04/ubiquitous-language-the-joy-of-naming/) for this project.

## Asset Issuer
[Asset Issuer]: #asset-issuer "An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN"

An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN. The Asset Issuer will specify the parameters of the contract template
that defines the rules that govern the asset and the number and nature of its constituent tokens on issuance. The Asset Issuer
will, generally, be the initial owner of the tokens.

## Bad Actor
[Bad Actor]: #bad-actor "A participant that acts maliciously or negligently to the detriment of the network or another participant"

A participant that acts maliciously or negligently to the detriment of the network or another participant.

## Base layer
[Base Layer]: #base-layer "The Tari layer handling payments and secured by proof of work"


The Tari Base layer is a merge-mined [blockchain] secured by proof-of-work. The base layer is primarily responsible for
the emission of new Tari, for securing and managing [Tari coin] transfers.


## Base Node
[base node]: #base-node "A full Tari node running on the base layer, validating and propagating Tari coin transactions and blocks"

A full Tari node running on the base layer. It's primary role is validating and propagating [Tari coin] transactions
and blocks to the rest of the network.


## Block
[block]: #block "A collection transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain"

A collection transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain. The ordering of
 Tari transactions is set purely by the block height of the block they are recorded in. 


## Block reward
[block reward]: #block-reward "The amount of Tari created in every block"

The amount of Tari created by the coinbase transaction in every block. The block reward is set by the 
[emission schedule].


## Blockchain
[blockchain]: #blockchain "The linked sequence of Tari blocks on the Tari base layer"

A sequence of tari [block]s. Each block contains a hash of the previous valid block. Thus the blocks form a chain 
with the property that changing anything in a block other than the head block requires rewriting the entire 
blockchain from that point on.

## Current head

[currenthead]: #currenthead	"The last valid block of the longest chain"

The last [block] of the base layer that represents the latest valid block. This [block] must be from the longest proof of work chain to be the current head. 

## Checkpoint

[checkpoint]: #checkpoint "A summary of the state of a Digital Asset that is recorded on the base layer"

A hash of the state of a Digital Asset that is recorded on the base layer.

## BroadcastStrategy

A strategy for propagating messages amongst nodes in a peer-to-peer network. Example implementations of
`BroadcastStrategy` include the Gossip protocol, Dandelion and flood fill.

## Coinbase transaction
[coinbase transaction]: #coinbase-transaction

The first transaction in every Tari block yields a [Block Reward] according to the Tari [emission Schedule] and is 
awarded to the miner that performed the Proof of Work for the block.

## Committee
[committee]: #committee "A group of validator nodes that are responsible for managing a specific Digital Asset"

A group of [Validator Node]s that are responsible for managing the state of a specific [Digital Asset]. A committee is selected
during asset issuance and can be updated at [Checkpoint]s.

## CommitteeSelectionStrategy
[CommitteeSelectionStrategy]: #committeeselectionstrategy "A strategy for the DAN to select candidates for the committee from the available registered Validator Nodes"
A strategy for the DAN to algorithmically select candidates for the committee from the available registered Validator Nodes. The VNs will need accept the nomination to become part of the committee.

## ConsensusStrategy
[ConsensusStrategy]: #consensusstrategy "The approach that will be taken for a committee to reach consensus on instructions"

The approach that will be taken for a committee to reach consensus on the validity of instructions that are performed on a
given Digital Asset.

## Commitment
[commitment]: #commitment

A commitment is a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from
others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. Commitments are designed so that one cannot change the
value or statement after they have committed to it.

## Communication Node 
[communication node]: #communication-node 'A communication node that is responsible for maintaining the Tari communication network'

A Communication Node is either a Validator Node or Base Node that is part of the Tari communication network. It maintains the network and is responsible for forwarding and propagating joining requests, discovery requests and data messages on the communication network.  

## Communication Clients 
[communication client]: #communication-client 'A communication client that makes use of the Tari communication network, but does not maintain it'

A Communication Client is a Wallet or Asset Manager that makes use of the Tari communication network to send joining and discovery requests. A Communication Client does not maintain the communication network and is not responsible for forwarding or propagating any requests or data messages.

## Digital asset
[digital asset]: #digital-asset 'Sets of Native digital tokens, both fungible and non-fungible that are created by 
asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer'

Digital assets (DAs) are the sets or collections of native digital tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) that are 
created by [asset issuer]s on the Tari 2nd layer. For example, a promoter might create a DA for a music concert event. The
 event is the digital asset, and the tickets for the event are digital asset [tokens].


## Digital Asset Network
[Digital Asset Network]: #digital-asset-network "The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed here."

The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed on the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN). These
interactions (defined in [instruction]s) are processed and validated by [Validator Node]s.

## DigitalAssetTemplate
[DigitalAssetTemplate]: #digitalassettemplate "A set of non-turing complete contract types supported by the DAN"

A DigitalAssetTemplate is one of a set of contract types supported by the DAN. These contracts are non-turing complete and consist of
rigid rule-sets with parameters that can be set by Asset Issuers.

## Digital asset tokens
[tokens]: #digital-asset-tokens 'or just, "tokens". The tokens associated with a given digital asset. Tokens are created
 by asset issuers'

Digital asset tokens (or often, just "tokens") are the finite set of digital entities associated with a given digital 
asset. Depending on the DA created, tokens can represent tickets, in-game items, collectibles or loyalty points. They
 are bound to the [digital asset] that created them.


## Instructions
[instruction]: #instructions "Second-layer network commands for managing digital asset state"

Instructions are the [digital asset network] equivalent of [transaction]s. Instructions are issued by asset issuers and
client applications and are relayed by the DAN to the [validator node]s that are managing the associated
[digital asset].


## Emission schedule
[emission schedule]: #emission-schedule

An explicit formula as a function of the block height, _h_, that determines the block reward for the 
_h_<sup>th</sup> block.


## Mempool
[mempool]: #mempool

The mempool is the set of transactions that have been validated by a base node, but have not yet been included in the
longest proof-of-work chain. Miners usually draw from the mempool to build up transaction [block]s.


## Mimblewimble
[mimblewimble]: #mimblewimble "a privacy-centric cryptocurrency protocol"

Mimblewimble is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency protocol. It was
[dropped](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.txt) in the Bitcoin Developers chatroom by an
anonymous author and has since been refined by several authors, including Andrew Poelstra.

## Mining Server
[mining server]: #mining-server

A Mining Server is responsible for constructing new blocks by bundling transactions from the [mempool] of a connected [Base Node]. It also distributes Proof-of-Work tasks to Mining Workers and verifies PoW solutions.

## Mining Worker
[mining worker]: #mining-worker

A Mining Worker is responsible for performing Proof-of-Work tasks received from its parent [Mining Server].

## Node ID
[node ID]: #node-id

A node ID is a unique identifier that specifies the location of a [Consensus Node] or [Consensus Client] in the Tari communication network. The node ID can either be obtained from registration on the [Base Layer] or can be derived from the public identification key of a [Consensus Node] or [Consensus Client]. 

## Range proof
[range proof]: #range-proof

A mathematical demonstration that a value inside a [commitment] (i.e. it is hidden) lies within a certain range. For
[Mimblewimble], range proofs are used to prove that outputs are positive values.

## RegistrationCollateral
[RegistrationCollateral]: #registrationcollateral "An amount of tari coin that is locked up on the base layer when a [Validator Node] is registered"

An amount of tari coin that is locked up on the base layer when a [Validator Node] is registered. In order to make Sybil attacks expensive and to
provide an authorative base layer registry of [validator node]s they will need to lock up a amount of [Tari Coin] on the [Base Layer] using a
registration transaction to begin acting as a VN on the DAN.

## RegistrationTerm
[RegistrationTerm]: #registrationterm "The minimum amount of time that a VN registration lasts"

The minimum amount of time that a VN registration lasts, the RegistrationCollateral can only be released after this minimum period has elapsed.

## SynchronisationStrategy

The generalised approach for a [Base Node] to obtain the current state of the blockchain from the peer-to-peer network.
Specific implementations may differ based on different trade-offs and constraints with respect to bandwidth, local
network conditions etc.


## SynchronisationState

The current synchronisation state of a [Base Node]. This can either be
* `new` - The blockchain state is empty and is waiting for synchronisation to begin.
* `synchronising` - The blockchain state is in the process of synchronising with the rest of the network.
* `synchronised` - The blockchain state has synchronised with the rest of the network and is in a position to validate
  transactions.

## Transaction
[transaction]: #transaction "Base layer tari coin transfers."

Transactions are activities recorded on the Tari [blockchain] running on the [base layer]. Transactions always involve a
transfer of [Tari coin]s.

## ValidationState

Transactions or blocks are `unvalidated` when first received by a [Base Node]. After validation, they are either
`rejected` or `validated`.

`Validated` transactions can be added to the [mempool] and propagated to peers.

`Validated` blocks are added to the [blockchain] and propagated to peers.

## Tari Coin
[tari coin]: #tari-coin "The base layer token"

The base layer token. Tari coins are released according to the [emission schedule] on the Tari [base layer] 
[blockchain] in [coinbase transaction]s.

## Trusted Node
[trusted node]: #trusted-node "A permissioned Validator Node nominated by an Asset Issuer"

A permissioned Validator Node nominated by an Asset Issuer that will form part of the committee for that Digital Asset.

## Token Wallet
[token wallet]: #token-wallet "An Asset Manager Wallet for Tari Assets and Tokens"

A Tari Token Wallet is responsible for managing [Digital asset]s and [Tokens], and for constructing and negotiating [instructions]s for transferring and receiving Assets and Tokens on the [Digital Asset Network]. 

## Unspent transaction outputs
[utxo]: #unspent-transaction-outputs

An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is a discrete number of Tari that are available to be spent. The sum of all 
UTXOs represents all the Tari currently in circulation. In addition, the sum of all UTXO values equals the sum of the
 [block reward]s for all blocks up to the current block height.

UTXO values are hidden by their [commitment]s. Only the owner of the UTXO and (presumably) the creator of the UTXO
(either a [Coinbase transaction] or previous spender) know the value of the UTXO.


## Validator Node
[validator node]: #validator-node "A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions"

Validator nodes (VNs) make up the Tari second layer, or [Digital Asset Network]. VNs are responsible for creating and
updating [digital asset]s living on the Tari network.

## Wallet
[wallet]: #wallet "A Wallet for Tari coins"

A Tari Wallet is responsible for managing key pairs, and for constructing and negotiating [transaction]s for transferring and receiving [tari coin]s on the [Base Layer]. 

## Pruning horizon

[pruninghorizon]: #pruninghorizon	"Block height at which pruning will commence"

This is a local setting for each node to help reduce syncing time and bandwidth. This is the number of blocks from the chain tip beyond which a chain will be pruned.

## Archive node

[archivenode]: #archivenode	"a full history node"

This is a full history [base node]. It will keep a complete history of every transaction ever received and it will not implement pruning.

## Blockchain state

[blockchainstate]: #blockchainstate	"This is a snapshot of how the blockchain looks"

This is a complete snapshot of the blockchain at a spesific block height. This means pruned [utxo], complete set of kernals and headers up to that block height from genesis block is known.
