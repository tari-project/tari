## Goals

The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to specify the deep links structure used in the Tari Aurora project.
The primary motivation is to create a simple, human-readable, and scalable way to structure deep links used by the Tari Aurora clients.

## Description

Deep links are the URIs with hierarchical components sequence. We can use this sequence to pass and handle data in a standardized and predictable way. To do that, we need to pass three components to the target client: the scheme, command, and data.

### Scheme
The scheme is used to address the client, which will handle the command and data components. In the Tari Aurora project, we're using the `tari` scheme to open the wallet app and execute the command.

### Command
The command is a path string used to pass information about the action that should be performed by the client. The handler uses this command to determine how to deserialize the data, before passing it to the command function.
To support multiple networks the first path component should be the name of corresponding network. Before proceeding with the command, the client should first check that the active account is pointed to the correct network, or show an error if there is a mismatch. 

For simple actions, the command can be defined as a single phrase. For more complex actions, the command should be defined as a multi-path where the second path component should be the name of the action group.

#### Examples:

Simple Actions:
```ignore
mainnet/user_profile
testnet/login
```
Complex Actions:
```ignore
mainnet/payments/send
testnet/payments/request
```

### Data
The data component is an optional string of key-value pairs used by the parser/decoder to deserialize the data, which the client passes to the command function. The data component should be formatted in the same way as a URL query. The sub-component should have a `?` prefix, the key-value pairs should be separated by `&`, and every key should be separated from the value by `=` character.

### The Structure
Combining all three components, they will form a deep link with a structure presented below:
```ignore
{scheme}://{command}?{data}
```
#### Examples:
```ignore
tari://mainnet/profile
tari://mainnet/profile/username
tari://testnet/payments/send?amount=1.23&pubKey=01234556789abcde
```

### Deeplinks in use:

* `/transactions/send`
   
The data contains transaction information used in the send tokens process.

| Value Name | Value Type | Note                         |
| ---------- | :--------: | ---------------------------- |
| publicKey  | String     | Receiver's public key        |
| amount     | UInt64?    | The amount in micro Tari     |
| note       | String?    | Note passed with transaction |

* `/base_nodes/add`

The data contains a custom base node configuration. This deep link adds a new base node configuration to the pool and switches to the added base node. 

| Value Name | Value Type | Note                                                        |
| ---------- | :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| name       | String     | The name of the base node                                   |
| peer       | String     | Base node's public link and onion address combined together |
