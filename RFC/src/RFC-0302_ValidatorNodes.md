## Goals

The goal of this RFC is to describe the responisibilities of Validator Nodes (VNs) on the DAN.

## Description
### Abstract
[Validator Node]s form the basis of the second layer DAN. All actions on this network take place by interacting with VN's. Some examples of actions
that VNs will facilitate are:
* Issuing a [Digital Asset],
* querying the state of [Digital Asset] and its constituent [tokens],
* issuing an instruction to change the state of a [Digital Asset] or [tokens].

VNs will also perform archival functions for the assets they manage. The lifetime of these archives and the fee structure for this function is
still being discussed.

#### Registration
VNs register themselves on the [Base Layer] using a special [transaction] type. The registration [transaction] type
requires the spending of a certain minimum amount of [Tari coin], the ([RegistrationCollateral]), that has a time-lock on the
output for a minimum amount of time ([RegistrationTerm]) as well as some metadata, such as the VNs public key and a generated [Node ID]. The Node ID is generated
during registration to prevent mining of VN public keys that can be used to manipulate routing on the DAN. The blinding factor for the Registration transaction is the private key
that the VN node will use to sign every instruction that it executes for the duration of its [RegistrationTerm].

Once a VNs [RegistrationTerm] has expired so will this specific VN registration. The UTXO timelock will have elapsed so the [RegistrationCollateral] can be reclaimed and a new VN registration
need to be performed. This automatic registration expiry will ensure that the VN registry stays up to date with active VN registrations and inactive registrations will naturally be removed.

Requiring nodes to register themselves serves two purposes:
* Makes VN Sybil attacks expensive,
* Provides an authoritative "central-but-not-centralised" registry of validator nodes from the base layer.

#### Execution of instructions
VNs are expected to manage the state of digital assets on behalf of digital asset issuers. They receive fees as reward
for doing this.
* Digital assets consist of an initial state plus a set of state transition rules. These rules are set by the Tari
  protocol, but will usually provide parameters that must be specified by the [Asset Issuer].
* The set of VNs that participate in managing state of a specific DA is called a [Committee]. A committee is selected during the asset
issuance process and membership of the committee can be updated at [Checkpoint]s.
* It is the VNs responsibility to ensure that every state change in a digital asset conforms to the contract's rules.
* VNs accept digital asset [Instructions] from clients and peers. [Instructions] allow for creating, updating, expiring and archiving digital assets on the DAN.
* VNs provide additional collateral when accepting an offer to manage an asset, which is stored in a multi-signature
  UTXO on the base layer. This collateral can be taken from the VN if it is proven that the VN engaged in
  malicious behaviour.
* VNs participate in fraud proof validations in the event of consensus disputes (which could result in the malicious VN's
  collateral being slashed).
* Digital asset metadata (e.g. large images) are managed by VNs. The large data itself will not be stored on the VNs but an external location and a hash of the data can be stored. Whether the data is considered part of the state
  (and thus checkpointed) or out of state depends on the type of digital asset contract employed.

#### Fees
Fees will be paid to VNs based on the amount of work they did during a checkpoint period. The fees will be paid from a fee pool which will be collected
and reside in a UTXO that is accessible by the committee. The exact mechanism for the the payment of the fees by the committee and who pays the various
types of fees is still under discussion.

#### Checkpoints
VNs periodically post checkpoint summaries to the [base layer] for each asset that they are managing. The checkpoints will form an immutable
record of the [Digital Asset] state on the base-layer. There will be two types of checkpoints:
* An Opening checkpoint (OC) will:
  * Specify the members of the VN committee.
  * Lock up the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period.
  * Collect the fee pool for this checkpoint period from the Asset Issuer into a Multi-Sig UTXO under the control of the committee.
  This can be a top-up of the fees or a whole new fee pool.

* A Closing checkpoint (CC) will:
  * Summarize the Digital Asset state on the base layer.
  * Release the fee pay outs.
  * Release the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period.
  * Allow for committee members to resign from the committee

After an DA is issued there will immediately be an Opening checkpoint. After a checkpoint period there will then be a Closing checkpoint followed
immediately by an Opening checkpoint for the next period, we will call this set of checkpoints an Intermediate checkpoint, which could be a compressed combination of an opening and closing checkpoint. This will continue
until the end of the asset's lifetime where there will be a final Closing checkpoint that will be followed by the retirement of the asset.

#### Consensus
Committees of VNs will use a [ConsensusStrategy] to manage the process of
* Propogating signed instructions between members of the committee.
* Determining when the threshold has been reached for an instruction to be considered valid.

Part of the [ConsensusStrategy] will be mechanisms for detecting actions by [Bad Actor]s. The nature of the enforcement actions that can be taken
against bad actors are still to be decided.

### Network communication
The VNs will communicate using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. To facilitate this this VNs must perform the following functions:
* VNs MUST maintain a list of peers, and which assets each peer is managing.
* VNs MUST relay [instructions] to members of the committee that are managing the relevant asset.
* VNs MUST respond to requests for information about digital assets that they manage on the DAN.
* VNs and clients can advertise public keys to facilitate P2P communication encryption
