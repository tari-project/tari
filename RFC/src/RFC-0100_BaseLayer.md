## Description

The Tari Base Layer network comprises the following major pieces of software:

* Base Layer full node implementation - The base layer full nodes are the consensus-critical pieces of software for the
  Tari base layer and cryptocurrency. The base nodes validate and transmit transactions and blocks and maintain
  consensus about the longest valid proof-of-work blockchain.
* Mining software - Mining nodes perform proof-of-work to secure the base layer and compete to submit the
  next valid block into the Tari blockchain. Tari is merge-mined with Monero. The Tari source provides two alternatives
  for Tari miners:
  * A standalone miner
  * A stratum-compatible pool miner.
* Wallet software - Client software and APIs offering means to construct transactions, query nodes for information and
  maintain personal private keys

These three main pieces of software make use of common functionality provided by the following libraries within the Tari
project source code:
* Local data storage
* Cryptography services
* Peer-to-peer networking and messaging services

[RFC-0010](RFC-0010_CodeStructure.md) provides more detail on how the source code is structured within the Tari codebase.
