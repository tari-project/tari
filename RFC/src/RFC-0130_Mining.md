## Description

### Assumptions
- That the Tari [blockchain] will be merged mined with Monero.
- The Tari [Base Layer] has a network of [Base Node]s that verify and propagate valid [transaction]s and [block]s. 

### Abstract

The process of merged mining Tari with Monero on the Tari Base Layer is performed by [Mining Server]s and [Mining 
Worker]s. Mining Servers are responsible for constructing new blocks by bundling transactions from the [mempool] 
of a connected Base Node. They then distribute Proof-of-Work(PoW) tasks to Mining Workers in an attempt to solve 
newly created blocks. Solved solutions and shares are sent by the Mining Workers to the Mining Server, who in turns 
verifies the solution and distributes the newly created blocks to the Base Node and Monero Node for inclusion in 
their respective blockchains.

### Merged mining on the Tari Base Layer

This document is divided into three parts. First, a brief overview of the merged mining process and the interactions 
between the Base Node, Mining Server and Mining Worker will be provided, then the primary functionality required 
of the Mining Server and Mining Worker will be proposed.

####  Overview of the Tari merged mining process using Mining Servers and Mining Workers

Mining on the Tari Base Layer consists of three primary entities: the Base Nodes, Mining Servers and Mining Workers. 
A description of the Base Node is provided in [RFC-0110/Base Nodes] (https://tari-project.github.io/tari/RFC-0110_BaseNodes.html).
A Mining Server is connected locally or remotely to a Tari Base Node and a Monero Node, and is responsible for 
constructing Tari and Monero Blocks from their respective mempools. The Mining Server should retrieve transactions 
from the mempool of the connected Base Node and assemble a new Tari block by bundling transactions together.

Mining servers may re-verify transactions before including them in a new Tari block, but this enforcement of 
verification and transaction rules such as signatures and timelocks are the responsibility of the connected Base node. Mining servers are responsible for [cut-through] as this is required for scalability and privacy.

To enable Merged mining of Tari with Monero, both a Tari and a Monero block needs to be created and linked. First, 
a new Tari block is created and then the block header hash of the new Tari block is included in the coinbase 
transaction of the new Monero block. Once a new merged mined Monero block has been constructed, PoW tasks can then 
be sent to the connected Mining Workers that will attempt to solve the block by performing the latest released 
version of the PoW algorithm selected by Monero.

Assuming the Tari difficulty is less than the Monero difficulty, miners get rewarded for solving the PoW at any 
difficulty above the Tari difficulty. If the block is solved above the Tari difficulty, a new Tari block is mined. 
If the difficulty is also greater than the Monero difficulty, a new Monero block is mined as well. In either event, 
the header for the candidate Monero block is included in the Tari block header.

If the PoW solution was sufficient to meet the difficult level of both the Tari and Monero blockchains, then the 
individual blocks for each blockchain can be sent from the Mining Server to the Base Node and Monero Node to be 
added to the respective blockchains.  

Every Tari block must include the solved Monero blockâ€™s information (block header hash, Merkle tree branch, and 
hash of the coinbase transaction) into the PoW summary section of the Tari block header. 
If the PoW solution found by the Mining Workers only solved the problem at the Tari difficulty, the Monero block can be discarded. 

This process will ensure that the Tari difficulty remains independent. Adjusting the difficulty will ensure that 
the Tari block times are preserved. Also, the Tari block time can be less than, equal 
or greater than the Monero block times. A more detailed description of the Merged Mining process between a Primary 
and Auxiliary blockchain is provided in the [Merged Mining TLU report] (https://tlu.tarilabs.com/merged-mining/merged-mining.html).

#### Functionality required by the Tari Mining Server

- The Tari blockchain MUST have the ability to be merged mined with Monero. 
- The Mining Server MUST maintain a local or remote connection with a Base Node and a Monero Node.
- It MUST have a mechanism to construct a new Tari and Monero block by selecting transactions from the different 
  Tari and Monero mempools that need to be included in the different blocks.
- It MUST apply [cut-through] when mining Tari transactions from the [mempool] and only add the excess to the list of new  Tari block transactions. 
- It MAY have a configurable transaction selection mechanism for the block construction process. 
- It MAY have the ability to re-verify transactions before including them in a new Tari block.
- It MUST have the ability to include the block header hash of the new Tari block into the coinbase section of a 
  newly created Monero block to enable merged mining.
- It MUST be able to include the Monero block header hash, Merkle tree branch and hash of the coinbase transaction 
  of the Monero block into the PoW summary field of the new Tari block header. 
- It MUST have the ability to transmit and distribute PoW tasks for the newly created Monero block, that contains 
  the Tari block information, to connected Mining Workers.
- It MUST verify PoW solutions received from Mining Workers and it MUST reject and discard invalid solutions or 
  solutions that do not meet the minimum required difficulty.
- The Mining Server MAY keep track of mining share contributions of the connected Mining Workers. 
- It MUST submit completed Tari blocks to the Tari Base Node.
- It MUST submit completed Monero blocks to the Monero Network.  

#### Functionality required by the Tari Mining Worker

- It MUST maintain a local or remote connection to a Mining Server.
- It MUST have the ability to receive PoW tasks from the connected Mining Server. 
- It MUST have the ability to perform the latest released version of Monero's PoW algorithm on the received PoW tasks.
- It MUST attempt to solve the PoW task at the difficulty specified by the Mining Server. 
- It MUST submit completed shares to the connected Mining Server.
