## Goals

The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the Tari Digital Asset templating system for smart contract 
definition.

The term “smart contracts” in this document is used to refer to a set of rules enforced by computers. These smart
contracts are not Turing complete, such as those executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (VM).

## Description

### Motivation

The reasons for issuing assets on Tari under a templating system, rather than a scripting language (whether Turing
complete or not), are manifold:

* A scripting language, irrespective of how simple it is, limits the target market for asset issuers to developers, or
  people who pay developers.
* The market doesn’t want general smart contracts. This is evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of Ethereum
  transactions go through ERC-20 or ERC-721 contracts, which are literally contract templates.
* The attack surface for smart contracts is reduced considerably, to the node software itself.
* Bugs can be fixed for all contracts simultaneously by using a template versioning system. Existing assets can opt in
  to fixes by migrating assets to a new version of the contract.
* Contracts will have better Quality Assurance (QA), since more eyes are looking at fewer contract code sets.
* Transmission, storage and processing of contracts will be more efficient, as one only has to deal with the parameters,
  and not the logic of the contract. Furthermore, the cost for users is usually lower, since there's no need to add
  friction or extra costs to contract execution (e.g. Ethereum gas) to work around the halting problem.

### Implementation

Assets are created on the Tari network by issuing a `create_asset` instruction from a wallet or client, and broadcasting
it to the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN).

The instruction is in JSON format and MUST contain the following fields:

| Name                               | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                             |

#### Committee Parameters

If `committee_mode` is `CREATOR_NOMINATION`, the `committee_parameters` object is:

| Name             | Type         | Description |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| trusted_node_set | Array of PKH | See below.  |

Only the nodes in the trusted node set will be allowed to execute instructions for this asset.

If `committee_mode` is `PUBLIC_NOMINATION`, the `committee_parameters` object is:

| Name                    | Type  | Description                                                                                                           |
|:------------------------|:------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| node_threshold          | `u32` | The required number of Validator Nodes (VNs) that must register to execute instructions for this asset.               |
| minimum_collateral      | `u64` | The minimum amount of Tari a VN must put up in collateral in order to execute instructions for this asset.            |
| node_selection_strategy | `u32` | The selection strategy to employ allowing nodes to register to manage this asset.                                     |


#### Issuer

Anyone can create new assets on the Tari network from their Tari Collections client. The client will provide the Public Key Hash (PKH) and
sign the instruction. The client needn’t use the same private key each time.

#### Name and Description

These fields are purely for information purposes. They do not need to be unique and do not act as an asset ID.

#### RAID ID

The RAID_ID is a 15-character string that associates the asset issuer with a registered Internet domain name on the Domain Name System (DNS).

If it is likely that a digital asset issuer will be issuing many assets on the Tari Network (hundreds or thousands),
the issuer should strongly consider using a registered domain (e.g. `acme.com`). This is
done via OpenAlias on the domain owner's DNS record, as described in [RFC-0301]. A RAID prevents spoofing of assets from 
copycats or other malicious actors. It also simplifies asset discovery.

Assets from issuers that do not have a RAID are all grouped under the default RAID.

RAID owners must provide a valid signature proving that they own the given domain when creating assets.

#### Fully Qualified Domain Name

The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that corresponds to the `raid_id` or the string `"NO FQDN"` to use the default RAID ID.
Validator Nodes (VNs) will calculate and check that the RAID ID is valid when
[validating the instruction signature](#signature-validation).

#### Public Nonce

A single-use public nonce to be used in the asset signature.

#### Asset Identification

Assets are identified by a 64-character string that uniquely identifies an asset on the network:

| Bytes | Description                                     |
|:------|:------------------------------------------------|
| 8     | Template type (hex)                             |
| 4     | Template version (hex)                          |
| 4     | Feature flags (hex)                             |
| 15    | RAID identifier (Base58)                        |
| 1     | A period character, `.`                         |
| 32    | Hex representation of the `metadata_hash` field |

This allows assets to be deterministically identified from their initial state. Two different creation instructions
leading to the same hash refer to the same single asset, by definition. VNs maintain an index of assets and
their committees, and so can determine whether a given asset already exists; and MUST reject any `create_asset`
instruction for an existing asset.

#### Template ID

Tari uses templates to define the behaviour for its smart contracts. The template ID refers to the type of digital asset
being created.

**Note:** Integer values are given in _little-endian_ format, i.e. the least significant bit is _first_.

The template number is a 64-bit unsigned integer and has the following format, with 0 representing
the least significant bit:

| Bit Range | Description                       |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| 0 - 31    | Template type (0 - 4,294,967,295) |
| 32 - 47   | Template version (0 - 65,535)     |
| 48        | Beta Mode flag                    |
| 49        | Confidentiality flag              |
| 50 - 63   | Reserved (must be 0)              |

The lowest 32 bits refer to the canonical smart contract type, i.e. the qualitative types of contracts the network supports.
Many assets can be issued from a single template.

Template types below 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) are public, community-developed templates.
All VNs MUST implement and be able to interpret instructions related to these templates.

Template types 65,536 and above are opt-in or proprietary templates. There is no guarantee that any given VN
will be able to manage assets on these templates. Part of the committee selection and confirmation process for new
assets will be an attestation by VNs that they are willing and able to manage the asset under the designated
template rules.

A global registry of opt-in template types will be necessary to prevent collisions (public templates existence will be
evident from the Validator Node source code), possibly implemented as a special transaction type on the base layer, 
which is perfectly suited for hosting such a registry. The details of this will be covered in a separate
proposal.

Examples of template types may be:

| Template Type | Asset                    |
| :------------ | :----------------------- |
| 1             | Simple single-use tokens |
| 2             | Simple coupons           |
| 20            | ERC-20-compatible        |
| ...           | ...                      |
| 120           | Collectible cards        |
| 144           | In-game items            |
| 721           | ERC-721-compatible       |
| ...           | ...                      |
| 65,537        | Acme In game items       |
| 723,342       | CryptoKitties v8         |

The template ID may also set one or more feature flags to indicate that the contract is:
* Experimental, or in testing phase (bit 48).
* Confidential. The definition of confidential assets and their implementation had not been finalized at the time of writing.

Wallets/client apps SHOULD have settings to allow, or otherwise completely ignore, asset types on the network that have
certain feature flags enabled. For instance, most consumer wallets should never interact with templates that have the
“Beta mode” bit set. Only developers' wallets should ever even see that such assets exist.

#### Asset Expiry

Asset issuers can set a future expiry date or block height, after which the asset will expire and nodes will be free to
expunge any/all state relating to the asset from memory after a fixed grace period. The grace period is to allow
interested parties (e.g. the issuer) to take a snapshot of the final state of the contract if they wish (e.g. proving
that you had a ticket for that epic World Cup final game, even after the asset no longer exists on the DAN).

Nodes will publish a final checkpoint on the base layer soon after expiry and before purging an asset.

The expiry_date is a Unix epoch, representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC if the value is
greater than 1,500,000,000; or a block height if it is less than that value (with 1 min blocks this scheme is valid
until the year 4870).

Expiry times should not be considered exact, since nodes don’t share the same clocks and block heights, and time proxies
become more inaccurate the further out you go (since height in the future is dependent on hash rate).

### Signature Validation

Validator nodes will verify the `creator_sig` for every `create_asset` instruction before propagating the instruction to
the network. The process is as follows:

1. The VN MUST calculate the metadata hash by hashing the canonical representation of all the data in the first three
   sections of the `create_asset` instruction.

2. The VN MUST compare this calculated value to the value given in the `metadata_hash` field. If they do not match, the 
VN MUST drop
   the instruction and STOP.

3. The VN MUST calculate the RAID ID from the `fqdn` and `issuer` fields as specified in [RFC-0301].

4. The VN MUST compare the calculated RAID ID with the value given in the `raid_id` field. If they do not match, the VN 
MUST drop
   the instruction and STOP.

5. If the `fqdn` is `"No FQDN", then skip to step 9.

6. The VN MUST Look up the OpenAlias TXT record at the domain given in `fqdn`. If the record  does not exist, then the 
VN MUST
   drop the instruction and STOP.

7. The VN MUST check that each of the public key and RAID ID in the TXT record match the values in the `create_asset`
   instruction. If any values do not match, the VN MUST then drop the instruction and STOP.

8. The VN MUST validate the registration signature in the TXT record, using the TXT record's nonce, the issuer's public
   key and the RAID ID. If the signature does not verify, the VN MUST drop the instruction and STOP.

9. The VN MUST validate the signature in the `creator_sig` field against the challenge built up from the issuer's public
   key, the nonce given in `public_nonce` field, the `raid_id` field and the `metadata_hash` field.

If step 9 passes, then the VN has proven that the `create_asset` contains a valid RAID ID, and that if a non-default
FQDN was provided, the owner of that domain provided the `create_asset` instruction. In this case, the VN SHOULD
propagate the instruction to the network.
