## Goals

This RFC describes and explains the Tari codebase layout.

## Related RFCs

None.

## Description

The code follows a Domain-Driven Design layout ([DDD]), with top-level directories falling into infrastructure, domain
and application layers.

### Infrastructure layer

This layer provides a set of crates which have general infrastructural utility. The rest of the Tari codebase can make use
of these crates to obtain persistence, communication and cryptographic services. The infrastructure layer doesn't know
anything about blockchains, transactions, or digital assets.

We recommend that code in this layer generalises infrastructure services behind abstraction layers as much as is
reasonable, so that specific implementations can be swapped out with relative ease.

### Domain layer

The Domain layer houses the Tari "business logic". All protocol-related concepts and procedures are defined and
implemented here.

This entails that any and all terms defined in the [Glossary] will have a software implementation here, and only here.
They can be _used_ in the Application layer, but must be implemented in the Domain layer.

The domain layer can make use of crates in the infrastructure layer to achieve its goals.

### Application layer

Applications build on top of the domain layer to produce the executable software that is deployed as part of the Tari
network.

As an example, the following base layer applications may be developed as part of the Tari protocol release:

* A standalone miner (tari_miner)
* A pool miner (tari_pool_miner)
* A CLI wallet for the Tari cryptocurrency (cli_wallet)
* A base node executable (tari_basenode)
* A REST API server for the base node

### Code layout

The top-level source code directories in this repository reflect the respective [DDD] layers; except that there are two
domain layer directories, corresponding to the two network layers that make up the Tari network.

1. The `infrastructure` directory contains application-layer code and is not Tari-specific. It holds the following
   crates:
    - `comms`: The networking and messaging subsystem
    - `crypto`: All cryptographic services, including a Curve25519 implementation
    - `storage`: Data persistence services, including an LMDB persistence implementation
    - `merklemountainrange`: An independant implementation of a merkle mountain range
    - `derive`: A crate to contain #[derive(...)] macros

1. `base_layer` is a domain-layer directory and contains:
    - `blockchain`: The Tari consensus code
    - `core`: common classes and traits, such as [Transaction]s and [Block]s
    - `mempool`: The unconfirmed transaction pool implementation
    - `mining`: The merge-mining modules
    - `p2p`: The block and transaction propagation module
    - `api`: interfaces for clients and wallets to interact with the base layer components
1. `digital_assets_layer` is a domain-layer directory. It contains code related to the management of native Tari digital
   assets.
   - Its sub-structure is TBD.
1. `applications` contains crates for all the application-layer executables that form part of the Tari codebase.
