# A sample log configuration file for running in release mode. By default, this configuration splits up log messages to
# three destinations:
#    * Console: For log messages with level INFO and higher
#    * log/proxy/proxy.log: All proxy logs will be written to this file
#
#  See https://docs.rs/log4rs/0.8.3/log4rs/encode/pattern/index.html for deciphering the log pattern. The log format
#  used in this sample configuration prints messages as:
#  timestamp [target] LEVEL message
refresh_rate: 30 seconds
appenders:
  # An appender named "proxy" that writes to a file with a custom pattern encoder
