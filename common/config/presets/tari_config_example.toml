# The maximum number of transactions that can be stored in the Unconfirmed Transaction pool. This is the main waiting
# area in the mempool and almost all transactions will end up in this pool before being mined. It's for this reason
# that this parameter will have the greatest impact on actual memory usage by your mempool. If you are not mining,
# you can reduce this parameter to reduce memory consumption by your node, at the expense of network bandwith. For
# reference, a single block can hold about 4,000 transactions
# Default = 40,000 transactions
# unconfirmed_pool_storage_capacity = 40000

# The maximum number of transactions that can be stored in the Orphan Transaction pool. This pool keep transactions
# that are 'orphans', i.e. transactions with inputs that don't exist in the UTXO set. If you're not mining, and
# memory usage is a concern, this can safely be set to zero. Even so, orphan transactions do not appear that often
# (it's usually a short chain of spends that are broadcast in quick succession). The other potential source of orphan
# transactions are from DOS attacks and setting the `tx_ttl` parameter to a low value is an effective countermeasure
# in this case. Default: 250 transactions
# orphan_pool_storage_capacity = 250

# The maximum amount of time an orphan transaction will be permitted to stay in the mempool before being rejected.
# This should be set to a fairly long enough to allow the parent transaction to arrive; but low enough also to thwart
# DOS attacks. Default: 300 seconds
#orphan_tx_ttl = 300

# The maximum number of transactions that can be stored in the Pending Transaction pool. This pool holds transactions
# that are valid, but cannot be included in a block yet becuase there is a consensus rule holding it back, usually a
# time lock. Once the conditions holding the transaction in the pending pool are resolved, the transaction will move
# into the unconfirmed pool.  Default: 5,000 transactions
# pending_pool_storage_capacity = 5000

# The ReorgPool consists of all transactions that have recently been added to blocks.
# When a potential blockchain reorganization occurs the transactions can be recovered from the ReorgPool and can be
# added back into the UnconfirmedPool. Transactions in the ReOrg pool have a limited Time-to-live and will be removed
# from the pool when the Time-to-live thresholds is reached. Also, when the capacity of the pool has been reached, the
# oldest transactions will be removed to make space for incoming transactions. The pool capacity and TTL parameters
# have the same meaning as those for the pending pool, but applied to the reorg pool; obviously.
# Defaults: 10,000 transactions and 300 seconds
#reorg_pool_storage_capacity = 10_000
#reorg_tx_ttl = 300

# The maximum number of transactions that can be skipped when compiling a set of highest priority transactions,
# skipping over large transactions are performed in an attempt to fit more transactions into the remaining space.
# This parameter only affects mining nodes. You can ignore it if you are only running a base node. Even so, changing
# this parameter should not affect profitabilty in any meaningful way, since the transaction weights are selected to
# closely mirror how much block space they take up
#weight_tx_skip_count = 20
