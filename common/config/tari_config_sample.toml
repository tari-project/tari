# This file carries all the configuration options for running Tari-related nodes and infrastructure in one single
# file. As you'll notice, almost all configuraton options are commented out. This is because they are either not
# needed, are for advanced users that know what they want to tweak, or are already set at their default values.  If
# things are working fine, then there's no need to change anything here.
#
# Each major section is clearly marked so that you can quickly find the section you're looking for. This first
# section holds configuration options that are common to all sections.

# A note about Logging - The logger is initialised before the configuration file is loaded. For this reason, logging
# is not configured here, but in `~/.tari/log4rs.yml` (*nix / OsX) or `%USERPROFILE%\.tari\log4rs.yml` (Windows) by
# default, or the location specified in the TARI_LOGFILE environment variable.

# Tari is a 100% peer-to-peer network, so there are no servers to hold messages for you while you're offline.

# message cache that for holding our peers' messages, in MB.

# You can set a time limit to release that ban (in minutes), or otherwise ban them for life (-1). The default is to
# ban them for 10 days.
