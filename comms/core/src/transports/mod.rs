//! # Transports
//!
//! Provides an abstraction for [Transport](self::Transport)s and several implemenations:
//! - [TCP](self::TcpTransport) - communication over TCP and IP4/IP6 and DNS
//! - [SOCKS](self::SocksTransport) - communication over a SOCKS5 proxy.
//! - [Memory](self::MemoryTransport) - in-process communication (mpsc channel), typically for testing.
