//! # Messaging Protocol
//!
//! A comms protocol extension that provides fire-and-forget messaging between peers.
//!
//! This protocol sends BLOBs to the given peer and imposes no opinions on the actual message.
//! This protocol will attempt to dial the peer if an active peer connection is not already present,
//! if this does not succeed, the message is discarded.
