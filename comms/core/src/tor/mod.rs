//! # Tor Hidden Services and Control Port Client
//!
//! These modules interact with the Tor Control Port to create hidden services on-the-fly.
//!
//! The [client](crate::tor::client) module contains the client library for the Tor Control Port. You can find the spec
//! [here](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt).
//!
//! The [hidden_service](crate::tor::hidden_service) module contains code which sets up hidden services required for
//! `tari_comms` to function over Tor.
