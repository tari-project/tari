/// # peer_connection
///
/// A peer connection is a bi-directional connection to a given [NetAddress]. The [Direction] of
/// a [PeerConnection] relates to which side initiate the connection. i.e for Inbound, this node
/// initiated the connection and waits for the peer to connect. For Outbound, this node is connecting
/// out to a listening socket. Frames can be sent and received over a single [Connection]. All received
/// messages are forwarded to a consumer connection.
///
/// The [PeerConnection] object starts a [Worker] which is responsible for establishing the required
/// connections. Two [Connections] are needed: a connection to/from the given [NetAddress] and a
/// connection to the consumer. A [ConnectionMonitor] is started which receives socket events from the
/// peer connection.
///
/// A [PeerConnection] consists of these modules:
///
/// 1. `connection` - responsible for starting and sending control messages to the PeerConnection
///                   worker thread.
/// 2. `context` - Builder for a `PeerConnectionContext` which is owned by a PeerConnection worker
///                thread. This provides all the information required to create the underlying
///                connections to the peer and consumer.
/// 3. `control` - Contains the control messages which can be sent from the [PeerConnection] to
///                the [Worker], as well as a thin wrapper around [std::sync::mpsc::Sender].
/// 4. `error` - Contains [PeerConnectionError]
/// 5. `worker` - Where all the work is done. Contains the code responsible for establishing
///               connections (peer and consumer), receiving messages to forward to the
///               consumer connection, updating the peer connection state from socket events
///               and receiving control messages and acting on them.
