//! Contains `Either` and related types and functions.
//!
//! See `Either` documentation for more details.
//!
//! Tari changes:
//! 1. Instead of defining a new private boxed error that all users of Either must "comply" with, this implementation
//!    requires that `A` and `B` both have the same error type. This suits our implementation as all errors are
//!    `RpcStatus` and removes the need for (often inelegant) error conversions.
