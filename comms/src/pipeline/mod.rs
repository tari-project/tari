//! # Comms Pipeline
//!
//! Comms Pipeline contains the middleware layers that can be composed when processing
//! inbound and outbound comms messages.
//!
//! For example, should you want your messages to be encrypted, you'll add the EncryptionLayer to
//! the outbound middleware stack and the DecryptionLayer to the inbound stack.
//!
//! Middlewares use `tower_layer` and `tower_service`. A Pipeline is simply any service which
//! is `Service<InboundMessage, Response = ()>`. This service will usually
//! be composed of other services by using the `tower_util::ServiceBuilder`.
