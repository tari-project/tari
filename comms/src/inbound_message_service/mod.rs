//! # Inbound Message Service
//!
//! The inbound message service is responsible for receiving messages from the active [PeerConnection]s
//! and fair-dealing them to one of the worker threads for processing.
//!
//! Worker thread will perform the following tasks:
//!
//! 1. Validate the message signature against the sender's public key.
//! 2. Attempt to decrypt the message with a ECDH shared secret if the MessageFlags::ENCRYPTED flag is set.
//! 3. Check the destination [NodeId] or [CommsPublicKey]
//! 3. Should steps 1-3 fail, forward or discard the message as necessary. See [comms_msg_handlers].
//! 4. Otherwise, dispatch the message to one of the configured message broker routes. See [InboundMessageBroker]
