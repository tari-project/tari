/// This is a specialised struct that represents a pruned hash set for Merkle Mountain Ranges.
///
/// The basic idea is that when adding a new hash, only the peaks to the left of the new node hierarchy are ever needed.
/// This means that if we don't care about the data earlier than a given leaf node index, n_0, (i.e. we still have the
/// hashes, but can't recalculate them from source), we _only need to store the local peaks for the MMR at that time_
/// and we can forget about the rest. There will never be a request for a hash other than those at the peaks for the
/// MMR with n_0 leaf nodes.
///
/// The awesome thing is that this struct can be dropped into [MerkleMountainRange] as a backend and it. just. works.
