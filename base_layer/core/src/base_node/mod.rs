//! The Tari base node implementation.
//!
//! Base nodes are the key pieces of infrastructure that maintain the security and integrity of the Tari
//! cryptocurrency. The role of the base node is to provide the following services:
//! * New transaction validation
//! * New block validation
//! * Chain synchronisation service
//! * A gRPC API exposing metrics and data about the blockchain state
//!
//! More details about the implementation are presented in
//! [RFC-0111](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0111_BaseNodeArchitecture.html).
