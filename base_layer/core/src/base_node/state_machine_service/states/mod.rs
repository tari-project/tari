//! The base node state represents the FSM of the base node synchronisation process.
//!
//! ## Starting state
//! The node is in the `Starting`` state when it's first created. After basic internal setup and configuration, it will
//! move to the `Listening` state.
//!
//! ## Listening
//!
//! In this state, we listen for chain tip updates from the network.
//!
//! The liveness service will periodically poll peers to request the chain tip height. If we are more than one block
//! behind the network chain tip, switch to `BlockSync` mode.
//!
//! ## BlockSync
//!
//! The BlockSync process first downloads the headers from the chain tip to the fork height on the local chain. The
//! chain of headers are constructed by first downloading the tip header based on the received best chain metadata and
//! then recursively downloading the previous header using the previous header hash recorded in the header until the
//! current local chain is reached. The next step is to download the individual blocks corresponding to the previously
//! downloaded headers, this is performed in a ascending order from the lowest height to the highest block height until
//! the tip is reached.
//!
//! After we have caught up on the chain, switch to `Listening`.
//!
//! If errors occur, re-request the problematic header or block.
//!
//! Give up after n failures and switch back to `Listening` (if a peer gave an erroneous chain tip and cannot provide
//! the blocks it says it has, we can switch back to `Listening` and try receive blocks passively.
//!
//! Full blocks received while in this state can be stored in the orphan pool until they are needed.
//!
//! ## Shutdown
//!
//! Reject all new requests with a `Shutdown` message, complete current validations / tasks, flush all state if
//! required, and then shutdown.
