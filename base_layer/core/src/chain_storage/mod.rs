//! This module is responsible for handling logic responsible for storing the blockchain state.
//!
//! It is structured in such a way that clients (e.g. base nodes) can configure the various components of the state
//! (kernels, utxos, etc) in whichever way they like. It's possible to have the UTXO set in memory, and the kernels
//! backed by LMDB, while the merkle trees are stored in flat files for example.
