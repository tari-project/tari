//! Blockchain state
//!
//! For [technical reasons](https://www.tari.com/2019/07/15/tari-protocol-discussion-42.html), the commitment in
//! block headers commits to the entire TXO set, rather than just UTXOs using a merkle mountain range.
//! However, it's really important to commit to the actual UTXO set at a given height and have the ability to
//! distinguish between spent and unspent outputs in the MMR.
//!
//! To solve this we commit to the MMR root in the header of each block. This will give as an immutable state at the
//! given height. But this does not provide us with a UTXO, only TXO set. To identify UTXOs we create a roaring bit map
//! of all the UTXO's positions inside of the MMR leaves. We hash this, and combine it with the MMR root, to provide us
//! with a TXO set that will represent the UTXO state of the chain at the given height:
//! state = Hash(Hash(mmr_root)|| Hash(roaring_bitmap))
//! This hash is called the UTXO merkle root, and is used as the output_mr
