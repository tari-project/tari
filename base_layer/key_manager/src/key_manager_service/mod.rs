// Note: For help in getting started with diesel as well as how to update the tables look here:
//       http://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/
//   - You also need to ensure that you installed diesel with the sqlite feature flag:
//     - 'cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite'
//   - If you updated the tables the following needs to be run from the base_layer/key_manager/ folder:
//     - 'diesel setup --database-url test.sqlite3'
//     - 'diesel migration run --database-url test.sqlite3'
//   - After running this, make sure that the diesel update did not change BigInt to Integer in 'schema.rs' (check for
//     any unwanted changes)
