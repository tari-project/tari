//! # Liveness Service
//!
//! This service is responsible for sending pings to any peer as well as maintaining
//! some very basic counters for the number of ping/pongs sent and received.
//!
//! It is responsible for:
//! - handling requests to the Liveness backend. Types of requests can be found in the [LivenessRequest] enum, and
//! - reading incoming [PingPong] messages and processing them.
//!
//! In future, this service may be expanded to included periodic pings to maintain
//! latency and availability statistics for peers.
