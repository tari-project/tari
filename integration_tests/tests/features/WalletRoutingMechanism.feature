Feature: Wallet Routing Mechanism

    @flaky @missing-steps
    Scenario Outline: Wallets transacting via specified routing mechanism only
      Given I have a seed node NODE
      #   And I have <NumBaseNodes> base nodes connected to all seed nodes
      #   And I have non-default wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes using <Mechanism>
      #   And I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
      #   And I have <NumWallets> non-default wallets connected to all seed nodes using <Mechanism>
      #   # We need to ensure the coinbase lock heights are gone and we have enough individual UTXOs; mine enough blocks
      #   And mining node MINER mines 20 blocks
      #  Then all nodes are at height 20
      #   # This wait is needed to stop base nodes from shutting down
      When I wait 1 seconds
      #   When I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 100000000 uT
      #   #When I print the world
      #   And I multi-send 1000000 uT from wallet WALLET_A to all wallets at fee 100
      #   # This wait is needed to stop next merge mining task from continuing
      When I wait 1 seconds
      #   And mining node MINER mines 1 blocks
      #  Then all nodes are at height 21
      #   Then all wallets detect all transactions as Mined_or_OneSidedUnconfirmed
      #   # This wait is needed to stop next merge mining task from continuing
      When I wait 1 seconds
      #   And mining node MINER mines 11 blocks
      #  Then all nodes are at height 32
      #   Then all wallets detect all transactions as Mined_or_OneSidedConfirmed
      #   This wait is needed to stop base nodes from shutting down
      When I wait 1 seconds

      #   Examples:
      #       # | NumBaseNodes | NumWallets | Mechanism      #       #     |

    Scenario: Store and forward TX
      Given I have a seed node SEED
      When I have a base node BASE connected to seed SEED
      When I have wallet SENDER connected to base node BASE
      When I have wallet RECEIVER connected to base node BASE
      #   And I stop wallet RECEIVER
      When I have mining node MINE connected to base node BASE and wallet SENDER
      #   And mining node MINE mines 5 blocks
      #   Then I wait for wallet SENDER to have at least 1000000 uT
      #   And I send 1000000 uT from wallet SENDER to wallet RECEIVER at fee 100
  #
  #
  # 10 minutes of waiting...
  #
  #
      # When I wait 121 seconds
      #   And I stop wallet SENDER
      # When I wait 360 seconds
      #   And I restart wallet RECEIVER
      # When I wait 121 seconds
      #   And I stop wallet RECEIVER
      #   And I restart wallet SENDER
      #   And wallet SENDER detects all transactions are at least Broadcast
