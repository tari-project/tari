  Scenario: As a wallet send to a wallet connected to a different base node
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a seed node SEED_B
    When I have a base node NODE_A connected to all seed nodes
    When I have a base node NODE_B connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_A with 10T connected to base node NODE_A
    When I have wallet WALLET_B connected to base node NODE_B
    When I wait 5 seconds
    When I transfer 5T from WALLET_A to WALLET_B
    When I mine 4 blocks on SEED_A
    Then wallet WALLET_A has 5T
    When I wait 5 seconds
    When wallet WALLET_B has 5T

  Scenario: As a wallet I want to submit multiple transfers
    Given I have a seed node NODE
    # Add a 2nd node otherwise initial sync will not succeed
    When I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
    When I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
    When I have wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_C connected to all seed nodes
    When mining node MINER mines 2 blocks
    Then all nodes are at height 2
    # Ensure the coinbase lock heights have expired
    When mining node MINER mines 3 blocks
    Then all nodes are at height 5
    # Ensure the coinbase lock heights have expired
    When mining node MINER mines 5 blocks
    Then all nodes are at height 10
    Then I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 10000000000 uT
    When I transfer 50000 uT from WALLET_A to WALLET_B and WALLET_C at fee 20
    When mining node MINER mines 10 blocks
    Then all nodes are at height 20
    Then all wallets detect all transactions as Mined_or_OneSidedConfirmed


  Scenario: As a wallet I want to submit transfers to myself
    Given I have a seed node NODE
    # Add a 2nd node otherwise initial sync will not succeed
    When I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
    When I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
    When mining node MINER mines 10 blocks
    Then all nodes are at height 10
    Then I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 10000000000 uT
    When I transfer 50000 uT to self from wallet WALLET_A at fee 25
    When I mine 5 blocks on NODE
    Then all nodes are at height 15
    Then all wallets detect all transactions as Mined_or_OneSidedConfirmed

  Scenario: As a wallet I want to create a HTLC transaction
    Given I have a seed node NODE
    # Add a 2nd node otherwise initial sync will not succeed
    When I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
    When I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
    When mining node MINER mines 10 blocks
    Then I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 10000000000 uT
    When I broadcast HTLC transaction with 5000000000 uT from wallet WALLET_A to wallet WALLET_B at fee 20
    When mining node MINER mines 6 blocks
    When I claim an HTLC transaction with wallet WALLET_B at fee 20
    When mining node MINER mines 6 blocks
    Then I wait for wallet WALLET_B to have at least 4000000000 uT

  Scenario: As a wallet I want to claim a HTLC refund transaction
    Given I have a seed node NODE
    # Add a 2nd node otherwise initial sync will not succeed
    When I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
    When I have wallet WALLET_C connected to all seed nodes
    When I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
    When I have mining node MINER_2 connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_C
    When mining node MINER mines 10 blocks
    Then I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 10000000000 uT
    When I broadcast HTLC transaction with 5000000000 uT from wallet WALLET_A to wallet WALLET_B at fee 20
    # atomic swaps are set at lock of 720 blocks
    When mining node MINER_2 mines 720 blocks
    When I wait 5 seconds
    When I claim an HTLC refund transaction with wallet WALLET_A at fee 20
    When mining node MINER_2 mines 6 blocks
    Then I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 9000000000 uT
