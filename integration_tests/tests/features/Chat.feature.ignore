    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_B
    Then CHAT_B will have 1 message with CHAT_A

  Scenario: A message is sent directly between nodes
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When CHAT_A adds CHAT_B as a contact
    When I stop node SEED_A
    When CHAT_A waits for contact CHAT_B to be online
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_B
    Then CHAT_B will have 1 message with CHAT_A

  Scenario: Message counts are distinct
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_C connected to seed node SEED_A

    When CHAT_A adds CHAT_B as a contact
    When CHAT_A adds CHAT_C as a contact
    When CHAT_B adds CHAT_C as a contact
    When CHAT_C adds CHAT_B as a contact
    When I stop node SEED_A

    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Message 1 from a to b' to CHAT_B
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Message 2 from a to b' to CHAT_B
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Message 1 from a to c' to CHAT_C

    When I use CHAT_B to send a message 'Message 1 from b to c' to CHAT_C
    When I use CHAT_B to send a message 'Message 2 from b to c' to CHAT_C

    When I use CHAT_C to send a message 'Message 1 from c to b' to CHAT_B

    Then CHAT_B will have 2 messages with CHAT_A
    Then CHAT_B will have 3 messages with CHAT_C
    Then CHAT_C will have 1 messages with CHAT_A
    Then CHAT_C will have 3 messages with CHAT_B
    Then CHAT_A will have 2 messages with CHAT_B
    Then CHAT_A will have 1 messages with CHAT_C

  Scenario: A message receives a delivery receipt
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_B
    When CHAT_B will have 1 message with CHAT_A
    Then CHAT_A and CHAT_B will have a message 'Hey there' with matching delivery timestamps

  Scenario: A message receives a read receipt
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_B
    When CHAT_B will have 1 message with CHAT_A
    When CHAT_B sends a read receipt to CHAT_A for message 'Hey there'
    Then CHAT_A and CHAT_B will have a message 'Hey there' with matching read timestamps

  Scenario: Fetches all addresses from conversations
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_C connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_D connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_B
    When I use CHAT_C to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_A
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message 'Hey there' to CHAT_D
    When CHAT_A will have 1 message with CHAT_B

    When CHAT_A will have 1 message with CHAT_D
    Then CHAT_A will have 3 conversationalists

  Scenario: A single message is fetched
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_A connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I have a chat client CHAT_B connected to seed node SEED_A
    When I use CHAT_A to send a message with id 'abcd1234' 'Hey there' to CHAT_B
    Then CHAT_A can find a message locally by id 'abcd1234'
