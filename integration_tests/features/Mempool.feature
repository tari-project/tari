  @critical @flaky
  Scenario: Transactions are propagated through a network
    #
    # The randomness of the TX1 propagation can result in this test not passing.
    # The probability of not passing (at least 2 nodes are not aware of TX1) is ~0.01%.
    #
    Given I have 8 seed nodes
    And I have a base node SENDER connected to all seed nodes
    And I have 8 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    When I mine a block on SENDER with coinbase CB1
    When I mine 2 blocks on SENDER
    When I create a transaction TX1 spending CB1 to UTX1
    When I submit transaction TX1 to SENDER
    Then SENDER has TX1 in MEMPOOL state
    Then TX1 is in the MEMPOOL of all nodes, where 1% can fail
