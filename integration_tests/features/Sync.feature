Feature: Block Sync

  Scenario Outline: Initial block sync
    Given I have <NumSeeds> seed nodes
    And I have a base node MINER connected to all seed nodes
    When I mine <NumBlocks> blocks on MINER
    Given I have <NumSyncers> base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    # All nodes should sync to tip
    Then all nodes are at height <NumBlocks>


    Examples:
      | NumSeeds | NumBlocks | NumSyncers |
      | 1        | 1         | 1          |

     @long-running
    Examples:
      | NumSeeds | NumBlocks | NumSyncers |
      | 1        | 10        | 2          |
      | 1        | 50        | 4          |

  Scenario: Simple block sync
    Given I have 1 seed nodes
    Given I have a SHA3 miner MINER connected to all seed nodes
    Given mining node MINER mines 20 blocks
    Given I have 2 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    # All nodes should sync to tip
    Then all nodes are at height 20

  @critical
  Scenario: Pruned mode simple sync
    Given I have 1 seed nodes
    Given I have a SHA3 miner NODE1 connected to all seed nodes
    When I mine a block on NODE1 with coinbase CB1
    And I mine 4 blocks on NODE1
    When I spend outputs CB1 via NODE1
    Given mining node NODE1 mines 15 blocks
    Given I have a pruned node PNODE1 connected to node NODE1 with pruning horizon set to 5
    Then all nodes are at height 20

  @critical
  Scenario: When a new node joins the network, it should receive all peers
    Given I have 10 seed nodes
    And I have a base node NODE1 connected to all seed nodes
    Then NODE1 should have 10 peers
    Given I have a base node NODE2 connected to node NODE1
    Then NODE1 should have 11 peers
    Then NODE2 should have 11 peers


  @critical
  Scenario: Pruned mode sync test
    Given I have a seed node SEED
    Given I have a base node NODE1 connected to all seed nodes
    When I mine a block on NODE1 with coinbase CB1
    And I mine 4 blocks on NODE1
    Then all nodes are at height 5
    When I spend outputs CB1 via NODE1
    And I mine 3 blocks on NODE1
    Given I have a pruned node PNODE2 connected to node NODE1 with pruning horizon set to 5
    Then all nodes are at height 8
    When I mine 15 blocks on PNODE2
    Then all nodes are at height 23

  @long-running @flaky
  Scenario: Node should not sync from pruned node
    Given I have a base node NODE1 connected to all seed nodes
    And I have a pruned node PNODE1 connected to node NODE1 with pruning horizon set to 5
    When I mine 40 blocks on NODE1
    Then all nodes are at height 40
    When I stop node NODE1
    Given I have a base node NODE2 connected to node PNODE1
    Given I have a pruned node PNODE2 connected to node PNODE1 with pruning horizon set to 5
    When I mine 5 blocks on NODE2
    Then node NODE2 is at height 5
    Then node PNODE2 is at height 40
    When I start base node NODE1
    # We need for node to boot up and supply node 2 with blocks
    And I connect node NODE2 to node NODE1 and wait 1 seconds
    # NODE2 may initially try to sync from PNODE1 and PNODE2, then eventually try to sync from NODE1; mining blocks
    # on NODE1 will make this test less flaky and force NODE2 to sync from NODE1 much quicker
    When I mine 10 blocks on NODE1
    Then all transactions must have succeeded
    Then all nodes are at height 50

  Scenario Outline: Syncing node while also mining before tip sync
    Given I have a seed node SEED
    And I have wallet WALLET1 connected to seed node SEED
    And I have wallet WALLET2 connected to seed node SEED
    And I have mining node MINER connected to base node SEED and wallet WALLET1
    And I have a base node SYNCER connected to all seed nodes
    And I have mine-before-tip mining node MINER2 connected to base node SYNCER and wallet WALLET2
    And I stop node SYNCER
    When mining node MINER mines <X1> blocks with min difficulty 1 and max difficulty 9999999999
    Then node SEED is at height <X1>
    When I start base node SYNCER
    # Try to mine much faster than block sync, but still producing a lower accumulated difficulty
    And mining node MINER2 mines <Y1> blocks with min difficulty 1 and max difficulty 10
    # Allow reorg to filter through
    Then node SYNCER is in state LISTENING
    Then node SYNCER is at the same height as node SEED
