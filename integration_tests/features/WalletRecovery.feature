    Scenario: Wallet recovery with connected base node staying online
        Given I have a seed node NODE
        And I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
        And I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
        And I have wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
        And I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
        When mining node MINER mines 10 blocks
        When I mine 5 blocks on NODE
        When I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 55000000000 uT
        Then all nodes are at height 15
        And I send 200000 uT from wallet WALLET_A to wallet WALLET_B at fee 25
        And I have mining node MINER_B connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_B
        When mining node MINER_B mines 2 blocks
        When I mine 5 blocks on NODE
        Then all nodes are at height 22
        Then I stop wallet WALLET_B
        When I recover wallet WALLET_B into wallet WALLET_C connected to all seed nodes
        When I wait for wallet WALLET_C to have at least 10000200000 uT
        And I have wallet WALLET_D connected to all seed nodes
        And I send 100000 uT from wallet WALLET_C to wallet WALLET_D at fee 25
        When I mine 5 blocks on NODE
        Then all nodes are at height 27
        Then I wait for wallet WALLET_D to have at least 100000 uT

    Scenario Outline: Multiple Wallet recovery from seed node
        Given I have a seed node NODE
        And I have <NumWallets> non-default wallets connected to all seed nodes using DirectAndStoreAndForward
        And I have individual mining nodes connected to each wallet and base node NODE
        Then I have each mining node mine 3 blocks
        Then all nodes are at height 3*<NumWallets>
        Then I stop all wallets
        When I recover all wallets connected to all seed nodes
        Then I wait for recovered wallets to have at least 15000000000 uT
        
        Examples:
            | NumWallets |
            | 4        |

        @long-running
        Examples:
            | NumWallets |
            | 5        |
            | 10        |
            | 20        |

    # BROKEN: recovery scans 15 blocks but does not actually recover any value. Tested manually and recovery works. Suspect something to do with using localnet (just a guess).

    Scenario: Recover one-sided payments
        Given I have a seed node NODE
        And I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
        And I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
        And I have wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
        And I have mining node MINER connected to base node NODE and wallet WALLET_A
        When mining node MINER mines 10 blocks
        Then all nodes are at height 10
        And I stop wallet WALLET_B
        # Send 2 one-sided payments to WALLET_B so it can spend them in two cases
        Then I send a one-sided transaction of 1000000 uT from WALLET_A to WALLET_B at fee 20
        Then I send a one-sided transaction of 1000000 uT from WALLET_A to WALLET_B at fee 20
        When mining node MINER mines 5 blocks
        Then all nodes are at height 15
        When I recover wallet WALLET_B into wallet WALLET_C connected to all seed nodes
        # BREAKS HERE
        Then I wait for wallet WALLET_C to have at least 2000000 uT
        # Send one of the recovered outputs back to Wallet A as a one-sided transactions
        Then I send a one-sided transaction of 900000 uT from WALLET_C to WALLET_A at fee 20
        When mining node MINER mines 5 blocks
        Then all nodes are at height 20
        Then I wait for wallet WALLET_C to have less than 1100000 uT
        # Send the remaining recovered UTXO to self in standard MW transaction
        Then I send 1000000 uT from wallet WALLET_C to wallet WALLET_C at fee 20
        Then I wait for wallet WALLET_C to have less than 100000 uT
        When mining node MINER mines 5 blocks
        Then all nodes are at height 25
        Then I wait for wallet WALLET_C to have at least 1000000 uT
