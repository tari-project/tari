        Scenario: Get Transaction Info
            Given I have a seed node NODE
            And I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
            And I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
            And I have wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
            And I have a merge mining proxy PROXY connected to NODE and WALLET_A
            When I merge mine 2 blocks via PROXY
            Then all nodes are at height 2
            When I wait 10 seconds
            And I send 1000000 tari from WALLET_A to one wallet WALLET_B at fee 100
            When I wait 10 seconds
            Then Transaction status of last result from WALLET_A to WALLET_B is known to both wallets
            When I merge mine 2 blocks via PROXY
            Then all nodes are at height 4
            When I wait 10 seconds
            Then Transaction status of last result from WALLET_A to WALLET_B is known to both wallets
